# String-Calculator-TDD

This is a **String Calculator** project implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology.

## Description

The String Calculator accepts a string of comma-separated numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. It supports multiple features, including handling custom delimiters, ignoring newlines, and throwing an exception for negative numbers.

## Features

- **Basic Addition**: Handles empty strings and one or more numbers.
- **Newline Support**: Allows numbers to be separated by newlines (`\n`).
- **Custom Delimiters**: Supports custom delimiters defined at the beginning of the string (e.g., `//;\n1;2`).
- **Negative Number Detection**: Throws an exception if negative numbers are included in the string, listing all negative numbers in the exception message.
